  <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <dd>Good day, Kiran. Are you ready to learn about <dfn>Thermodynamics</dfn> and <dfn>Statistical Mechanics</dfn>? Great! Then let's begin.</dd>

  <h3>Thermodynamics</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>In thermodynamics, we're interested in energy and heat flow of a system. A <dfn>system</dfn> is just a collection of &ldquo;things&rdquo; that we're interested in&mdash;a chunk of material, multiple chunks of the same material, multiple materials, gases or liquids, magnets&hellip; it could be anything, really. And collectively, this system has some properties that we're interested in&mdash;things like internal energy, pressure, and temperature.</dd>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>Good day, Kiran. Are you ready to learn about <dfn>Thermodynamics</dfn> and <dfn>Statistical Mechanics</dfn>?</dd>
    <dt class="virion_talks">Virion</dt>
      <dd>Oh, my fair Lady Cecilia. How dazzling you look today!</dd>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>&hellip;And Virion is here to help out. I pray he won't be a distraction.</dd>
    <dt class="virion_talks">Virion</dt>
      <dd>Why, of course not! We are doing this for our good Kiran's sake, are we not? Kiran, should you find any part of our discussion unclear, do not hesitate to ask either of us. We will do our best to clarify your understanding.</dd>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>We are all set for the lesson? Then let's begin. <dfn>Thermodynamics</dfn> is the study of heat flow between objects during a process, and quantities that are helpful to describe such a situation. <dfn>Statistical Mechanics</dfn> is analyzing a large number of physical objects or particles not by considering each one individually, but rather by considering statistical averages taken across the group.</dd>
    <dt class="virion_talks">Virion</dt>
      <dd>And it may seem at first glance that these two subjects are entirely unrelated, but a potentially surprising fact is that when you try to analyze physical systems in a statistical mechanics way, the results you obtain correspond exactly to the results of thermodynamics. The statistical averages that we care about turn out to be exactly the thermodynamic quantities relating to heat.</dd>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>As a note, there will of course be some level of mathematics involved in these calculations. But if you need to take a moment to review a concept, please do! We can wait, and once you've caught up, we can continue on. Or you can even ask us to explain it! I'll try to point out when we use certain mathematical concepts.</dd>

<div id="equilibrium_div" class="main">
  <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt class="virion_talks">Virion</dt>
      <dd>Let us start by defining <dfn>equilibrium</dfn>. We say that a system is in equilibrium after we let it sit for a long time, isolated from anything outside the system. Shielding the system from its onlookers' raucous provocations, we allow it to reveal its true splendor!</dd>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>Virion has quite the way of expressing it, but he's correct in concept. Now, what would we expect such a system to do? Oh, you look confused, Kiran. I suppose this is all very abstract. We could mean almost anything by the word "system." </dd>
    <dt class="boey_talks">Boey</dt>
      <dd style="color: red"><b>TODO: This should be Boey. That'd probably be easier to write than Virion. Or maybe someone else. Boey can be reserved for learning how to wield Big Hurty Lightning from Robin teaching E&amp;M.</b></dd>
    <dt class="cecilia_talks">Cecilia</dt>
      <dd>We should talk about the <dfn>state</dfn> of a system. We can think of it as a collection of variables that describe everything that we want to know about a system right now. But that's the catch&mdash;<em>we</em> get to choose what variables these are. In statistical mechanics, for example, we might have a position and momentum for every single particle in our system. That's what we might call a <em>microstate</em>, because it's looking up close at all the details of the system. But we also tend not to care about these tiny details&mdash;indeed, historically, we didn't even know about what was going on at a microscopic level. But we could still measure macroscopic properties, giving us <dfn>macrostate</dfn>. So we might have a gas, for example, with a particular temperature, volume, pressure, or entropy. But these things are not all independent.</dd>
